Blank App gives a new application a solid, opinionated starting point: a
TypeScript monorepo with a React web client and a NestJS API, strict tooling,
tests, CI/CD, and documented engineering standards — so teams start building
features on day one instead of wiring up foundations.

### Using this as your base

1. Fork/clone and rename the repo and the root `package.json` name.
2. Replace the `HuttonHomeHub/WorkHub` repository references with your GitHub
   org/repo — search for `HuttonHomeHub/WorkHub` and `huttonhomehub/workhub`
   (GHCR image names are lower-case). They appear in the README badges,
   [`CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS), [`.changeset/config.json`](.changeset/config.json),
   [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), the issue-template config, the compose files, and
   [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
3. Optionally rename the `@repo/*` package scope to your own.
4. Replace this README, `CLAUDE.md` §1, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/BACKLOG.md`
   with your application's content.
5. Build your first feature with `pnpm gen:feature <entity>`
   ([`docs/REFERENCE_FEATURE.md`](docs/REFERENCE_FEATURE.md)) via the delivery
   process ([`docs/PROCESS.md`](docs/PROCESS.md)).

## 🚀 Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 24 (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)), pnpm ≥ 10 (via
`corepack enable`), and Docker (for local PostgreSQL) — or open it in
GitHub Codespaces / a dev container, which sets all of this up for you
([`.devcontainer/`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)).

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/HuttonHomeHub/WorkHub.git && cd WorkHub

# 2. Bootstrap (installs deps, creates .env, starts Postgres)
./scripts/setup.sh

# 3. Run everything in dev mode
pnpm dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:5173> and sign in as **dev@example.com** /
**dev-password-123** — `setup.sh` seeds that development account. The base
ships a working auth walking skeleton (email/password sessions, a protected
shell, owner-based access — ADR-0016). Public sign-up is off by default: create
real accounts with `pnpm user:create` (ADR-0018).

Or run the full stack in containers (served at <http://localhost:8080>,
migrations applied automatically):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Production deployment (pinned GHCR images behind your own reverse proxy) is
covered in [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) and
[`docker-compose.prod.yml`](docker-compose.prod.yml).
