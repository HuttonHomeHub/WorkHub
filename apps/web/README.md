# @repo/web

The Blank App web client: **React 19 + TypeScript + Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS v4**
and **shadcn/ui** components, using **Lucide** icons.

> **Status:** walking skeleton. The app entry, providers, router, auth feature
> (open signup / sign-in / sign-out with a protected shell), and base
> primitives are live. The **architecture** is defined in
> [`docs/FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../docs/FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md), the
> **design system** in [`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](../../docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)
> (tokens implemented in [`src/styles/globals.css`](src/styles/globals.css)),
> and UX/component/quality standards in the sibling docs. Read those before
> building UI.
