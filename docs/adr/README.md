# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory holds our Architecture Decision Records — short documents that
capture a significant, architecturally-relevant decision, its context, and its
consequences. The practice itself is described in
[ADR-0001](0001-record-architecture-decisions.md).

## Why

Decisions have long lifespans and their rationale is easily lost. ADRs give
future maintainers (human or AI) the _why_, not just the _what_.

## Conventions

- One decision per file, named `NNNN-title-in-kebab-case.md` (zero-padded,
  monotonically increasing).
- Statuses: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`, `Deprecated`.
- **ADRs are immutable once accepted.** To change a decision, add a new ADR that
  supersedes the old one; update the old one's status to point at it. Never
  delete an ADR.
- Use [`_template.md`](_template.md) as the starting point.
